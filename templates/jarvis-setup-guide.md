# ü§ñ J.A.R.V.I.S Multi-Agent System Setup Guide

## Overview

J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system built in n8n that combines multiple AI models to handle different types of tasks intelligently. Each agent specializes in a specific domain and works together to provide comprehensive assistance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Agent Specialization:
- **Input Processing Agent (GPT-4)**: Analyzes user intent and routes requests
- **Research Agent (GPT-4)**: Handles information gathering and analysis
- **Creative Agent (Claude)**: Manages creative content and innovative solutions
- **Technical Agent (GPT-4)**: Solves technical problems and provides guidance
- **Planning Agent (Gemini)**: Creates project plans and strategic thinking
- **Communication Agent (GPT-4)**: Handles professional communications
- **Response Generation Agent (GPT-4)**: Formats final responses

### Workflow Flow:
```

```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Import the Workflow
1. Open n8n
2. Go to **Workflows** ‚Üí **Import from File**
3. Select `jarvis-multi-agent-workflow.json`
4. Click **Import**

### 2. Configure API Keys

#### OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4 agents):
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Credentials**
2. Create new **OpenAI** credential
3. Add your OpenAI API key
4. Test the connection

#### Claude API Key (for Creative Agent):
1. Create new **Anthropic** credential
2. Add your Claude API key
3. Test the connection

#### Google Gemini API Key (for Planning Agent):
1. Create new **Google** credential
2. Add your Gemini API key
3. Test the connection

### 3. Configure Webhook
1. Click on **J.A.R.V.I.S Input** node
2. Note the webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/jarvis`)
3. This is your J.A.R.V.I.S endpoint

### 4. Test the System
Send a POST request to your webhook URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/jarvis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Help me plan a marketing campaign for our new product",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "session_id": "session456"
  }'
```

## üéØ Agent Capabilities

- **Use Cases**: Information gathering, fact-checking, market research
- **Example**: "What are the latest trends in AI technology?"
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (focused and factual)

### Creative Agent (Claude)
- **Use Cases**: Content creation, brainstorming, creative problem-solving
- **Example**: "Write a creative marketing slogan for our product"
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (creative and innovative)

### Technical Agent (GPT-4)
- **Use Cases**: Code debugging, technical troubleshooting, system design
- **Example**: "Help me debug this Python function"
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (precise and technical)

### Planning Agent (Gemini)
- **Use Cases**: Project planning, strategic thinking, resource allocation
- **Example**: "Create a project timeline for launching our app"
- **Temperature**: 0.4 (balanced and strategic)

### Communication Agent (GPT-4)
- **Use Cases**: Email drafting, professional communications, stakeholder management
- **Example**: "Draft an email to inform clients about our service update"
- **Temperature**: 0.5 (professional and diplomatic)

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Input Processing
- User sends a message to the webhook
- Input Processing Agent analyzes the request
- Determines intent and complexity
- Routes to appropriate specialized agent

### 2. Agent Routing
The system uses an IF node to route requests based on agent type:
- **RESEARCH** ‚Üí Research Agent
- **CREATIVE** ‚Üí Creative Agent
- **TECHNICAL** ‚Üí Technical Agent
- **PLANNING** ‚Üí Planning Agent
- **COMMUNICATION** ‚Üí Communication Agent

### 3. Specialized Processing
- Each agent processes the request with its specialized knowledge
- Maintains context from the original input
- Provides domain-specific expertise

### 4. Response Generation
- Response Generation Agent formats the output
- Ensures natural, conversational tone
- Maintains J.A.R.V.I.S personality
- Adds relevant follow-up suggestions

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Customization Options

#### 1. Add New Agents
To add a new specialized agent:
1. Create a new OpenAI/Claude/Gemini node
2. Add it to the agent router
3. Update the routing logic
4. Configure the specialized prompt

#### 2. Modify Agent Prompts
Each agent has a specialized system prompt that can be customized:
- Edit the `content` field in the `messages` section
- Adjust temperature and maxTokens for different behaviors
- Add domain-specific instructions

#### 3. Add Memory System
To add conversation memory:
1. Add a Vector Store node (Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.)
2. Store conversation history
3. Retrieve relevant context for each request

#### 4. Add Tool Integration
To add external tools:
1. Add HTTP Request nodes for API calls
2. Integrate with databases, file systems, etc.
3. Allow agents to execute actions beyond text generation

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Execution Logs
- Monitor each agent's performance
- Track response times and success rates
- Identify bottlenecks in the workflow

### Usage Analytics
- Track which agents are used most frequently
