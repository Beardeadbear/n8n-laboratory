5. **Submit the information in Fliplet**

## Step 1 ‚Äì Get Google Services File

1. **Log in to your Google Firebase account**
2. **Ensure you select the app** you are updating your push notification service for

**üìù Note:** If you have not previously registered your app for a project you will need to do this first. Each app should have a separate firebase project.

3. **Select the Android app** in the project
4. **For the Android package name** - Enter the Bundle id found in the Google publish tab of Studio
5. **Click on "register app"**
6. **This will enable you to download** the google-services file

### Download the Services File

## Why Upgrade from GCM to FCM?

### GCM Deprecation
- **Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)** is being discontinued
- **Complete removal** after June 20, 2024
- **No new features** or security updates
- **Limited support** for legacy implementations

### FCM Benefits
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** is the modern replacement
- **Enhanced security** and authentication
- **Better performance** and reliability
- **Advanced features** and capabilities
- **Long-term support** and updates

## Technical Requirements

### Firebase Project Setup
- **Active Firebase project** for your app
- **Android app registration** in Firebase
- **Google services configuration** file
- **Project permissions** and access rights

### Google Cloud Configuration
- **Service account creation** for FCM
- **API key generation** for authentication
- **Role assignment** for proper permissions
- **Project selection** and configuration

## Security Considerations

### Service Account Management
- **Secure key storage** and management
- **Limited permissions** following least privilege
- **Regular key rotation** for security
- **Access monitoring** and logging

### API Security
- **Secure API key handling** in your app
- **HTTPS communication** for all requests
- **Authentication validation** for notifications
- **Rate limiting** and abuse prevention

## Migration Best Practices

### Planning and Preparation
- **Test the upgrade process** in a development environment
- **Backup existing configurations** before making changes
- **Plan for downtime** during the migration
- **Communicate changes** to your users

### Testing and Validation
- **Verify notification delivery** after upgrade
- **Test on multiple devices** and Android versions
- **Validate user experience** and functionality
- **Monitor performance** and reliability

### Rollback Planning
- **Keep old configurations** as backup
- **Document rollback procedures** if needed
- **Test rollback process** before production
- **Maintain support** for both systems during transition

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Configuration Problems
- **Incorrect bundle ID** - Verify the package name matches exactly
- **Missing permissions** - Check service account roles and permissions
- **Invalid API keys** - Ensure keys are properly generated and configured
- **Project mismatch** - Confirm you're working with the correct Firebase project

### Notification Delivery Issues
- **Token generation problems** - Verify FCM configuration in your app
- **Authentication failures** - Check API key validity and permissions
- **Device registration issues** - Ensure proper FCM SDK integration
- **Network connectivity** - Verify internet access and firewall settings

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

### Verification and Testing
- **Send test notifications** to verify functionality
- **Monitor delivery rates** and performance
- **Check user engagement** with notifications
- **Validate error handling** and fallback mechanisms

### Documentation Updates
- **Update technical documentation** with new configurations
- **Revise user guides** for notification features
- **Maintain configuration records** for future reference
- **Share best practices** with your development team

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Set up monitoring** for notification delivery
- **Track performance metrics** and trends
- **Regular security reviews** of configurations
- **Plan for future updates** and enhancements
