**Description:** Learn how to use the slider component to create a multi-step form

## Overview

Using the slider component in Fliplet Studio will enable you to create multi-step forms and enhance user experience by breaking down lengthy forms into manageable steps.

This article explains how to use Fliplet's Slider component to build a multi-step form by organizing content across multiple slides within a single screen.

## Screen Template

We have also created a screen template to give you a pre-made example. If you chose to start by using the screen template you can skip to step 3 where you can follow the instructions to further customize your form.

**To find the screen template:**
1. Click the "add screens" button inside your Fliplet app
2. Add the "Multi-step sign up" screen to your app

## Get Started

1. **Add the Slider component**
2. **Configure slider settings**
3. **Add slides for each step**
4. **Add forms to slides**
5. **Customize form fields**
6. **Add navigation buttons**
7. **Add the submit button**
8. **Preview and test the form**

## Step 1 – Add the Slider Component

1. **Start by opening your app** and navigating to the screen where you want to add the form
2. **Open the component library**
3. **Drag and drop the Slider container component** onto the screen

## Key Benefits of Multi-step Forms
