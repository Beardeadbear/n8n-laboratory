**Description:** Understand how to use and manage multi-environments in Fliplet Studio

## Overview

This article will guide you through the process of setting up new environments in Fliplet and configuring them to best suit your app editing needs while maintaining security. You'll learn how to create a new organization, add users, duplicate apps, replace sensitive data, merge screens, and test before publishing. By the end, you'll have a properly structured environment that supports efficient app development and collaboration.

## Environment Overview

### Production Environment
Production environment refers to the live version of your Fliplet organization where your apps are fully functional, accessible to end users, and contain all active user data. Any changes made here directly impact your users.

### Staging Environment
Staging environment refers to a testing version of your Fliplet organization where you can safely make changes, test new features, and review updates without affecting active users or sensitive data. Use staging for development and quality assurance before pushing changes live.

## Get Started

The multi-environment setup process includes:

1. **Invite existing users**
2. **Prepare apps for copying**
3. **Copy apps to production**
4. **Merge screens**
5. **Test and launch**

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Step 1 â€“ Invite Existing Users

1. **Log in to the organization** you wish to invite users to
2. **From My apps, click Organizational dashboard**
3. **Select the Users tab**
4. **Click Invite user**
5. **Enter the email of each existing user** and assign the appropriate role
6. **Click Invite user**
7. **Users will see the new environment** by clicking their name in the topâ€‘right corner
8. **To switch between each organization**, users can select from the dropdown menu

## Key Benefits of Multi-environment Setup

### Development Workflow
- **Safe testing environment** for new features and changes
- **Isolated development** without affecting production users
- **Collaborative development** with multiple team members
- **Version control** for app iterations

### Security and Data Protection
- **Separate data sources** for development and production
- **Sensitive data isolation** between environments
- **User access control** for different environments
- **Data backup and recovery** options

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive testing** before production deployment
- **User acceptance testing** in staging environment
- **Performance testing** without production impact
- **Bug identification and fixing** before release

## Environment Management Best Practices

### Environment Separation
- **Clear naming conventions** for different environments
- **Separate user accounts** for development and production
- **Isolated data sources** to prevent data mixing
- **Environment-specific configurations** and settings

### User Access Control
- **Role-based permissions** for different environments
- **Limited production access** to authorized users only
- **Development team access** to staging environments
- **Regular access reviews** and permission updates

### Data Management
- **Sensitive data replacement** in development environments
- **Test data creation** for development purposes
- **Data synchronization** between environments when needed
- **Data cleanup** procedures for development environments

## App Management Across Environments

### App Duplication
- **Copy apps** from production to staging
- **Maintain app structure** across environments
- **Update app configurations** for environment-specific needs
- **Version tracking** for app changes

### Screen Management
- **Merge screens** between environments
- **Screen version control** for tracking changes
- **Conflict resolution** when merging changes
- **Screen testing** in staging before production

### Data Source Configuration
- **Environment-specific data sources** for development
- **Test data creation** and management
- **Data source security** rules for each environment
- **Data migration** procedures between environments

## Testing and Deployment

### Pre-deployment Testing
- **Functional testing** of all app features
- **User interface testing** across different devices
- **Performance testing** to ensure app responsiveness
- **Security testing** to verify data protection

### Launch Process
- **Staged rollout** to minimize production impact
- **User communication** about upcoming changes
- **Rollback procedures** in case of issues
- **Post-launch monitoring** and support

### Quality Assurance
- **User feedback collection** after deployment
- **Performance monitoring** in production
- **Issue tracking** and resolution
- **Continuous improvement** based on user experience

## Common Use Cases

### Enterprise Development
- **Large team collaboration** on app development
- **Multiple stakeholder review** processes
- **Compliance and security** requirements
- **Scalable development** workflows

### Agency Work
- **Client approval processes** before production
- **Multiple client projects** in separate environments
- **Client-specific testing** and validation
- **Professional development** standards

### Educational Projects
- **Student development** environments
- **Course project management** and review
- **Academic collaboration** across departments
- **Research project** development and testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Environment access problems** - Check user permissions and invitations
- **App copying failures** - Verify app configurations and data sources
- **Screen merge conflicts** - Resolve conflicts before proceeding
- **Data synchronization issues** - Check data source configurations

### Getting Help
