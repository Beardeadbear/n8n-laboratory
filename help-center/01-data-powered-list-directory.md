**Description:** Step by step instructions on how to use the Data Powered List screen templates

## Overview

The Data Powered List Directory and Detail screen templates provides a powerful way to create searchable directories with dynamic profile views. Ideal for staff directories, service listings, or contact databases, these templates are powered by Fliplet's Data Powered list component.

## Get started

1. Add the screen templates
2. Connect the screens
3. Connect or change your data source
4. Match your data source columns to the template
5. Preview and test

### Step 1 – Add the screen templates

1. Add the **Data Powered List – Directory list** and the **Data Powered List – Directory profile** screen templates to your app by clicking the "add screens" button inside your app
2. Select both screens and choose "add 2 new screens"
3. This creates your Directory screen (list view) and your Detail screen (profile view)

### Step 2 – Connect the screens

1. First, open the Directory screen
2. Select the **Data container** component to open the **Settings** panel on the right-hand side
3. Under **Click Action**, select "display another screen" and chose the Detail Screen (e.g., "Data Powered List – Directory profile")
4. This allows tapping a record in the Directory Screen to open its corresponding Detail Screen.

### Step 3 – Connect or change your data source

1. Click the **Data Container** on each screen to open the **Settings** panel
2. Use the dropdown to select your desired data source

**Note:** If you're using your own data source, be sure to use the same one for both screens.

### Step 4 – Match your data source columns to the template

If you're using a custom data source, ensure your column names match what the templates expect.

**Data Image Components**

1. Click on an image component
2. Open the **Settings** panel
3. Check the column it's connected to (e.g., "Image")

Update this if your column uses a different name (e.g., "ProfilePhoto")

**Data Text Components (e.g., First Name, Role)**

1. Click on the text component to open the **Settings** panel on the right hand side
2. Confirm the column name (e.g., "first name")
3. Update the reference if your column uses a different name (e.g., "FullName")

### Step 5 – Preview and test

1. To test and preview your list, switch to preview mode by selecting **Preview** in the top right hand corner
2. Tap a record in the directory Screen to confirm it opens the correct detail Screen
3. Review all dynamic content (images, text, contact info)
4. Test on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) to confirm responsiveness
