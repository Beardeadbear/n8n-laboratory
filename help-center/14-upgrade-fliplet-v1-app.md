**Description:** How to update your V1 app to be compatible with the current version of Fliplet Studio

## Overview

Apps created before 2021 are likely to be using Fliplet Studio Version 1. This means that current Fliplet features such as drag-and-drop functionality, screen structure visibility, and updated appearance settings are not available in these apps. Some features in the Fliplet V1 apps are no longer compatible with Fliplet Studio, and therefore apps created on V1 require an upgrade.

This article will take you through the steps to update your app to be compatible with the current version of Fliplet Studio.

## Get Started

The upgrade process includes:

1. **Backup your app**
2. **Contact Fliplet support**
3. **Review new components**
4. **Upgrade appearance settings**
5. **Check and update all screens**
6. **Replace text HTML**
7. **Use containers to replace divs**
8. **Final checks and best practices**

## How to Upgrade Your App

### Step 1 – Backup Your App

Before you begin, you must create a backup of your app. This copy will serve as a reference during the upgrade process and help ensure you have a fallback version if needed.

1. **Log into your Fliplet Studio account**
2. **Find your app and click the "more" drop down**
3. **Click "duplicate" to create a copy of your app**
4. **Name this copy as your backup** for future reference
