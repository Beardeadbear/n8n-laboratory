**Description:** Learn how to edit the digital business card

## Overview

The digital business card is available as part of the Directory solution. This article will detail and explain what data can be presented as part of the digital business card and how to edit the data.

## What is the Digital Business Card?

The digital business card is a public profile that can be accessed by anyone via scanning a QR code.

### Key Features

- **Users can access their QR code** from the home screen, by clicking "My QR code"
- **The digital business card can include links** to social media, phone calls, emails, portfolios, etc.
- **You can also use the "add to contacts" option** to add the user to your device contacts
- **Using Studio, the layout can be edited** and the data will be populated using the user's directory profile information

**üìù Note:** The app needs to be published for this feature to work correctly, and scanning the QR code whilst in Studio will not work. It should be tested and viewed via the live app only.

## How to Edit the Digital Business Card Information

Below is a representation of the "Directory ‚Äì VCard Info" data source that is linked in the directory solution for editing the information that is downloaded from the user's profile to a device's contacts.

### Data Source Structure

The "User Data" column is the name of the column in the "Directory ‚Äì People" data source that should be used to edit the data.

These should be adjusted based on the columns you have. Leaving this blank will mean that this item will not be included in the contact card download. The "vcard" column is what will be used in the file download. For the digital business card to work correctly, you need to ensure that the data source is properly configured.
