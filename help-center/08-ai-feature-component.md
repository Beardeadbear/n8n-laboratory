## Get Started

The AI feature creation process includes:

1. **Add the AI feature component to your screen**
2. **Configure a data source (optional)**
3. **Enter your AI prompt**
4. **Generate and review the feature**
5. **Refine and regenerate (optional)**
6. **Save and preview your feature**
7. **AI feature ideas and inspiration**

## Step 1 â€“ Add the AI Feature Component to Your Screen

1. **Open your app in Fliplet Studio**
2. **Navigate to the screen** where you want to add the AI feature
3. **From the "Add components" panel**, scroll to the "Others" section and find the "AI Feature" component
4. **Drag and drop the "AI Feature" component** onto your app screen

## Step 2 â€“ Configure a Data Source (Optional)

If your AI-generated feature needs to store or display data, connect it to a data source.

1. **In the AI Feature settings panel**, go to the "Data source" section
2. **Select an existing data source** or click "Create new data source"
3. **Enter a name in the pop-up window** and click "OK"
4. **Click "Configure security rules"** to apply default access rules
5. **Confirm the rules** to enable app user access

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can further edit security rules via "View data source". For more information on data source security rules, see [Recommended minimum data source security rules](https://help.fliplet.com/recommended-minimum-data-source-security-rules/).

## Step 3 â€“ Enter Your AI Prompt

This is where you describe the feature you want to generate.

1. **In the AI Feature settings panel**, find the "Prompt" textbox
2. **Expand the "What features are available?"** section to see examples and guidelines
3. **Write a clear, descriptive prompt** explaining what you want the AI to create
